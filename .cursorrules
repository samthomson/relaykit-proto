# Relaykit-proto – Cursor rules

- Be concise. Prefer short answers and small edits unless the user asks for detail or docs.
- No long essays or unnecessary preamble.
- Stack: Vite/React frontend, Node + tRPC backend, Dokploy for deployment. Presets live under `app/presets/`.
- Prefer editing existing code over adding new files. Match existing style and patterns.
- When touching Docker/Dokploy/Traefik, keep the current setup in mind: one shared reverse proxy for the stack, not per-container.
