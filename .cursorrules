# Relaykit-proto – Cursor rules

- Answer concisely. No pointless markdown docs, no braindead AI essays. Talk like a normal human.
- Prefer short answers and small edits unless the user explicitly asks for more.
- Stack: Vite/React frontend, Node + tRPC backend, Dokploy. Presets under `app/presets/`.
- Edit existing code over adding files. One shared reverse proxy for the stack, not per-container.
